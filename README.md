# Election Commission Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Election Commission Data Analysis project repository! This project focuses on cleaning, processing, and analyzing data from the 2014 and 2019 Indian Election Commission datasets. Using Python, DAX commands, and Power BI, we have created insightful reports and visualizations to understand electoral trends and patterns.

## Project Overview

### Data Sources
- **2014 Election Data**: Proovided in Main repo
- **2019 Election Data**: Provided in main repo

### Tools Used
- Python for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Power BI for data visualization and report generation.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated columns and measures in Power BI.

## Contents of the Repository

1. **Data Cleaning Scripts**: Python scripts used to clean and preprocess raw election data.
   
2. **Processed Data**: Cleaned datasets ready for analysis.

3. **Power BI Reports**: Interactive reports showcasing various insights and trends:
   - Voter demographics analysis.
   - State-wise and constituency-wise voting patterns.
   - Comparative analysis between 2014 and 2019 elections.
   
4. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on data cleaning steps, Power BI reports, and analytical approaches.

## Future Aim

### Analytical Goals

#### Voting Patterns Analysis
- Investigate voting trends across different states and constituencies.
- Identify demographic factors influencing voting behavior.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Define and measure KPIs such as voter turnout rate, percentage of winning margins, etc.

#### Most Successful MPs
- Analyze and rank MPs based on factors like election margin, constituency development indices, etc.

#### Future Prediction Model
- Develop predictive models to forecast election outcomes based on historical data and trends.

#### Integrated Online Voting Panel
- Design and implement an online voting system with synchronized database management.
- Ensure security, transparency, and accessibility in the voting process.
