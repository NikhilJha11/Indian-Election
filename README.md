Election Commission Data Analysis Project
Welcome to the Election Commission Data Analysis project repository! This project focuses on cleaning, processing, and analyzing data from the 2014 and 2019 Indian Election Commission datasets. Using Python, DAX commands, and Power BI, we have created insightful reports and visualizations to understand electoral trends and patterns.

Analytical report available in Bi format as well as PDF.
